# Evolving Deep Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithm

This project demonstrates the application of genetic algorithms for evolving deep neural networks. It simulates natural selection to optimize neural network configurations, aiming to enhance performance on specific tasks. The iterative process involves evolving a population of neural networks, and adjusting their parameters and architecture for improved results.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Leverages genetic algorithms for fine-tuning neural network architectures and parameters.
- **Customizable Network DNA**: Each neural network configuration is encapsulated as 'DNA', comprising network dimensions, activation functions, and solver types.
- **Dynamic Population Management**: Manages a population of neural networks through selection, crossover, and mutation.
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Employs a fitness function to evaluate the performance of individual networks.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Adaptable to various datasets and neural network types.
